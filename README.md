# Number Guessing Game
In short: A little game where you have to guess random numbers with various settings and some music in the background (which has to be enabled in the settings menu). As this is originally from 2019 without any major fixes and developments (besides the music and final touches), not all features are implemented. Especially the countdown and console are not fully implemented.
